        Hi, my name is Mark, and I am a software developer student at Bellevue
        University. I was born and raised in
        <span id="Chicago">_________</span> and moved to Seattle in 2011. I like
        to be physically active and play
        <span id="Apex">_________</span> Legends in my free time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My childhood was pretty normal. After graduating high school, I moved to
        Washington in 2011 because of the military, where I served for Operation
        Enduring
        <span id="freedom">_________</span>. Then I pursued a degree in audio
        engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        After college, I decided to pursue personal training for about 2.5 years
        until Covid hit. Most of my clients were developers and thought I would
        be a great fit in the scene, so I took Covid as a sign to switch career
        paths. I took a coding bootcamp and am now currently pursuing my BA in
        software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, I am a retail manager alongside being a TA for a coding
        bootcamp. Hopefully, I will be graduating this year and finding a career
        in the developer scene. I am excited about the opportunities that await
        in the field of Software <span id="development">_________</span>.
