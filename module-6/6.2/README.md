### Lab 6.2

## Project Overview

This lab project for CSD 340 (Web Development with HTML and CSS) involves the creation of a simple yet functional web page designed to showcase a list of "Top 5 Favorite Foods" with hyperlinks to their recipes. The project focuses on applying HTML and CSS skills to build a structured and styled web page.

## Project Structure

- `module-6/`
  - `LastName_Mod6_2.html` - Main HTML document for the webpage.
  - `LastName_Mod6_2.css` - CSS file for styling the webpage.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a New Folder:** Inside your local `csd-340` repository, create a new folder named `module-6`.
2. **HTML Document:** Create a new HTML document named `LastName_Mod6_2.html`. Replace "LastName" with your actual last name. This file will contain all HTML code for the lab project.
3. **CSS Document:** Create a new CSS document named `LastName_Mod6_2.css`. This file will hold all CSS styling for your project.
4. **Link to Index:** Add a hyperlink in the `index.html` file to navigate to `LastName_Mod6_2.html`, facilitating easy access to the new web page.

## Development Guidelines

- **HTML Document:** Start with an empty HTML document template. Include a document title, link to your CSS file, a header tag with an assignment title, a navigation bar (`navbar`), a main content container (`container`), and a footer.
- **CSS Styling:** Use the CSS file to style your HTML document, following the specifications provided for background colors, text colors, padding, margins, box shadows, and hover effects.
