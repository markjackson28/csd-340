        <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
        <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Mark, and I am a software developer student at Bellevue University. I was born and raised in Chicago and moved to Seattle in 2011. I like to be physically active and play Apex Legends in my free time.</p>
        <p>My childhood was pretty normal. After graduating high school, I moved to Washington in 2011 because of the military, where I served for Operation Enduring Freedom. Then I pursued a degree in audio engineering.</p>
        <p>After college, I decided to pursue personal training for about 2.5 years until Covid hit. Most of my clients were developers and thought I would be a great fit in the scene, so I took Covid as a sign to switch career paths. I took a coding bootcamp and am now currently pursuing my BA in software development.</p>
        <p>At the moment, I am a retail manager alongside being a TA for a coding bootcamp. Hopefully, I will be graduating this year and finding a career in the developer scene. <span class="sentence">I am excited about the opportunities that await in the field of software development.</span></p>
