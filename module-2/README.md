# Module 2 Assignment README

## Overview
This assignment builds upon the concepts learned in Chapters 7, 8, and 10 of the course textbook. It involves creating a well-structured HTML document with an accompanying CSS stylesheet, focusing on formatting and design.

## Part 1: HTML Document Setup

1. **Directory and File Creation**:
   - Create a new directory named `module-2` in your local `csd-340` folder.
   - Create an HTML document named `<LastName_Mod2_2>.html` in the `module-2` directory.
   - Create a CSS document named `<LastName_Mod2_2>.css` and add it to the `module-2` directory.

2. **HTML Document Content**:
   - Add four meta tags in the `<head>` section.
   - Link the CSS file using `<link>` tag in the `<head>`.
   - Set the title to “CSD 340 Development with HTML and CSS”.
   - In the `<body>`, add a `<div>` with an ID of “container”.
   - Add an `<h1>` with the text: “Assignment 2.3 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2”.
   - Add an `<h2>` with a chapter title of your choosing.
   - Write four paragraphs describing yourself, each wrapped in `<p>` tags.
     - Assign the first paragraph a CSS class of “intro”.
     - Pick a sentence in any paragraph and wrap it with `<span>` having a CSS class of “sentence”.
   - Add a horizontal line using `<hr />`.
   - Add Bellevue University's address and a URL to their website under the horizontal line using `<address>`.

3. **Validation**:
   - Validate the HTML document using the W3C validator and ensure 0 errors.

   - Set weights for `h1` (700) and `h2` (500).
   - Apply a line-height of 1.4em to paragraph texts.
   - Style the `h1` to be uppercase and centered.
   - Align `h2` to the left with a top padding of 15px.
   - Center-align the address text.
   - Style the website URL (bold, font-size 1.25em, color #4F3674) and remove the underline.
   - Apply hover and visited pseudo-classes to the website link.
     - Underline on hover with a background color of #D6A800.
     - Choose a style for the visited pseudo-class.
